# Sustainable Building Modeller – Sample Scripts
This repository contains a collection of sample scripts for use within the Sustainable Building Modeller application.

These scripts are written in Lua and are designed to be executed using the app’s built-in script editor, available in version 1.3.1.0 or later. They demonstrate how to automate tasks, analyze elements, interact with the model, and extend the app’s functionality using scripting.
