<h1>General App Guides</h1><p>This page provides an overview of various app features and functionalities in the Sustainable Building Modeller. The information below helps you understand how to work with elements, systems, and the environment.</p><h2>Element Networks</h2><p>Element networks are used to organize elements, add related element types to proper groups, and define node-link relations. Here are the available element networks:</p><ul>  <li><b>Column-Floor</b>: For adding floor elements, can be set to a building element.</li>  <li><b>Floor-Column</b>: For adding columns, can be set to a building element.</li>  <li><b>Wall-Column</b>: For adding walls, can be set to a structural system or a building element.</li>  <li><b>Room-Column</b>: For adding rooms and zones, can be set to a building element.</li>  <li><b>Liquid-Pipe-Fitting</b>: For liquid piping system elements, is set to liquid piping system.</li>  <li><b>Duct-Fitting</b>: For HVAC system elements, is set to HVAC system.</li>  <li><b>Cable-Joint</b>: For electrical system elements, is set to electrical system.</li>  <li><b>Attachment</b>: For attaching appliances to holders, is set to the active system.</li>  <li><b>Ray Tracing</b>: For ray tracing elements, is set to the ray tracing system.</li>  <li><b>Structural-Link-Node</b>: For structural links and nodes, is set to the structural system.</li></ul><p>Some active networks can be assigned manually. When a network can be set to an element, such as a building, you can change the active network by right-clicking on the element and activating the system.</p><h2>System Types</h2><p>In the Sustainable Building Modeller app, elements are categorized by different systems (e.g., HVAC, electrical, plumbing). These systems help organize elements based on their function within the project. When you add a new element to a project, it is automatically assigned to the appropriate system:</p><ul>  <li><b>Structural System</b></li>  <li><b>Liquid Distribution System</b></li>  <li><b>Electrical System</b></li>  <li><b>HVAC System</b></li>  <li><b>Ray Tracing System</b></li></ul><h2>Working Folder</h2><p>When the application starts for the first time, it asks you to choose a working folder. The software uses this folder whenever it needs to save and load files. The software will not have access to files and folders outside the working folder. The working folder should not have other files or folders than those created by the S.B.M software. Whenever you reinstall or update the software, it will ask you again to choose the working folder. If you already had a working folder, you can choose the old one without any problems.</p><p>If you are planning to use the Frame3DD converter, it's better that the working folder address doesn't contain any spaces. Otherwise, the Frame3DD program won't be able to read the generated Frame3DD input files, and you will have to copy them somewhere else.</p><h2>Element Description</h2><p>You can show an element description on the model. To do this, open the element properties, go to the Product Tab, and check "Display product description". The value in the description field will be shown beside the element in the 3D model. The text scale can be set from the Application Settings, Display tab.</p><h2>Refreshing Model</h2><p>If you notice some elements are not showing properly in the model, you can press <b>U</b> or <b>Escape</b> to refresh the scene.</p><h2>Insulated Elements</h2><p>When creating insulated elements, such as tanks, pipes, or appliances, the insulation is added as a child element to the tank. You can edit the insulation by choosing it from the solution tree.</p><h2>Work Plane</h2><p>Work planes can be used to choose points in 3D space. It's hidden by default, but you can unhide it from the solution tree.</p><h2>Coordinate System</h2><p>You can toggle between right-hand and left-hand coordinate systems by checking the Application Settings, Display, and selecting the "Right-Hand Coordinate System" option.</p><p>This guide will continue to be expanded with more information as new features are added to the app.</p>
